Executive Summary (one paragraph)

Aegis Sentinel Suite is a terminal-first, fully integrated security platform combining an ultra-high-throughput recon engine (10k host target), always-on passive network defense that auto-detects/flags unknown devices and collects router/device forensics, and a deterministic response orchestrator that performs safe verification, automated containment, remediation playbooks, and generates signed forensic reports. Everything is designed to run as production-ready Go services or single-file binaries with structured logs, Prometheus metrics, encrypted evidence storage, PDF incident generation, and APIs for integration. This is the entire product — all features are included and enabled.

MODULE 1 — Aegis: Core Scanning & Reconnaissance Engine (CLI)
Goal

High-performance parallel scanner that discovers hosts, enumerates ports/services, fingerprints stacks, maps to CVEs and MITRE ATT&CK, logs forensic-grade output, and provides machine-readable exports and telemetry. CLI-first, scriptable, and orchestratable.

Key Capabilities

Massive concurrent scans: tuned worker pool + semaphore rate-limiting to sustain scans of ~10,000 hosts (top-100 ports) in controlled lab environments.

Discovery: ARP, ICMP, TCP SYN, UDP probes, hybrid passive+active discovery mode.

Port & Service Scans: async non-blocking scanning; banner grabbing; protocol negotiation; TLS cert analysis.

Fingerprinting: HTTP tech stacks, JS/CMS detection, OS heuristics via TCP/IP, TTL, and other fingerprints.

Vuln Mapping: local CVE signature DB, version mapping, heuristics for misconfigurations, map-to-MITRE ATT&CK.

CLI UX: subcommands and flags: aegis scan, aegis discover, aegis watch, output modes (json|ndjson|sarif|csv), --concurrency, --rate, --dry-run, optional TUI (termui).

Outputs & Exports: structured JSON/NDJSON, SARIF, pcap captures, SARIF for dev tooling, and direct SIEM forwarding via syslog/Elastic/Kafka/webhook.

Observability: Prometheus metrics endpoint; /metrics with scan_count, active_workers, avg_latency, queue_depth, failed_tasks.

Concurrency & Scalability

Worker-pool pattern with configurable pool size and backpressure queue.

Semaphore-based per-target rate limiting; eviction policies to protect OOM.

Horizontal-ready task model for a Phase 1.5 coordinator (gRPC) if you later shard scans.

Performance Targets & Testing

Synthetic testbeds (tcpreplay & containerized mock services) to validate scanning 10k hosts.

CI pipeline: unit tests, integration tests, nightly performance runs, memory-leak detection.

MODULE 2 — Gatehound: Passive Defense & IP-Locating System
Goal

Always-on passive monitoring that detects unknown/suspicious devices touching the company’s network, fingerprints device + router info, enriches IP ownership + geolocation + ASN + WHOIS, maintains tamper-evident evidence, triggers alerts, and auto-generates universal, polished PDF incident reports containing full forensic metadata (signed manifest & chain-of-custody).

Key Capabilities

Passive capture: libpcap/gopacket listeners on chosen interfaces; SPAN/mirror and inline capture modes supported.

Event detection: ARP announcements, DHCP leases, mDNS, DNS, TLS handshakes, HTTP User-Agent detection, unusual TTLs, ARP anomalies.

Unknown-device flagging: policy-driven rules (asset inventory compare, OUI mismatch, DHCP oddities, anomalous UA).

Fingerprinting & Enrichment:

MAC/OUI lookup, DHCP option fingerprint, TLS SNI & cert extraction, HTTP header snippets, TTL-based OS heuristics.

GeoIP (MaxMind) lookup, ASN, reverse DNS, WHOIS/RDAP summary, historical sightings correlation.

Router/Gateway identification: ARP + lightweight traceroute to determine gateway device and enqueue gateway fingerprinting.

Threat correlation: blacklist matching, TI feed integration (STIX/TAXII adapters), scoring engine.

Automated PDF reports: universal, legal/forensics-friendly layout (cover, executive summary, timeline, device profile, router info, geolocation map snapshot, threat scoring, recommended remediation, appendices, signed footer).

Tamper-resistant evidence: encrypted rotated PCAPs, SHA-256 hashes, ed25519-signed manifests and report signatures.

Alerting & action hooks: webhooks, syslog, Kafka, Slack, email, SIEM, optional NAC/firewall triggers to isolate devices.

CLI & Operator Commands

PDF Incident Template (Universal)

Cover page, executive summary, ISO8601 timeline, device profile (IP/MAC/OUI/DHCP/HTTP/TLS), router/gateway facts, network evidence summary (pcap path), geo & ASN maps, threat scoring, correlation, action log, remediation steps, appendices with raw JSON and signed manifest.

Performance Targets & Resilience

Handle SPAN feeds on 1Gbps (or higher with sampling & filtering).

Enrichment caching and batched WHOIS/RDAP queries to avoid latency spikes.

PCAP chunking + rotation, encrypted by policy, and prune by retention rules.

MODULE 3 — Revenant: Active Response & Remediation Orchestrator
Goal

Convert detections into safe verification and automated action: sandbox verification (non-destructive PoC), containment (NAC/firewall/EDR), remediation playbooks, human approval flows, signed remediation reports, and re-verification scans — all with full audit trail and measurable metering.

Key Capabilities

Sandbox verification: ephemeral containers/VMs that run read-only, timeboxed, and network-isolated PoC checks to validate exploitability or suspicious behavior.

Containment actions: NAC port isolate, switch port disable, firewall rule add (on-prem and cloud), revoke VPN sessions, EDR quarantine & process kill.

Remediation playbooks: idempotent YAML playbooks (actions + rollbacks + approvals). Example playbook: quarantine → snapshot → forensic upload → patch verify → credential reset → re-scan → close.

Orchestration engine: task queue, retries, exponential backoff, dead-letter queue, RBAC for approvals, audit tokens.

API-first design: REST/gRPC endpoints for triggering playbooks, status, logs, and retrieving signed remediation reports.

Signed remediation artifacts: PDF/JSON reports with signed changelogs, before/after evidence, operator signature.

Human + machine workflows: manual approval gates and auto-approve thresholds based on scoring.

CLI & Operator Commands

revenant run-playbook --id=pb-<id> --target=host-123 --auto-approve

revenant sandbox-verify --evidence=evt-<id>

revenant tasks list --status=running

Sandbox & Safety

Use OCI containers or lightweight VMs with strict seccomp/apparmor and network egress disabled unless explicitly allowed.

Enforce per-task CPU/memory/time quotas, snapshotting, and automatic teardown.

Playbooks and action plugins must be signed and allow-listed in production.

Throughput & Latency Goals

Baseline single-node: 50 concurrent sandbox verifications, 100s of containment tasks per minute depending on external API latencies.

Latency: containment actions ideally sub-second to seconds; sandbox verification seconds to minutes (timeboxed).

Cross-Module Shared Infrastructure & Features
Data Flow (holistic)
[Sensor & CLI Input] ->
  Aegis (active recon) -> findings -> central event bus
  Gatehound (passive monitor) -> events -> central event bus
Central event bus -> correlation & scoring -> persist evidence -> alert -> Revenant (verify & remediate) -> signed reports -> re-scan by Aegis -> close

Common Services & Integrations

Metrics: Prometheus endpoints on each module; Grafana recommended for dashboards.

Logging: Structured JSON logs (schema: {timestamp, session_id, operator, module, target, action, result, severity}).

Storage: local encrypted store (Badger/LevelDB) for quick metadata; large blobs & pcaps encrypted and stored in configurable object store (S3-compatible) or local encrypted filesystem.

Evidence Integrity: SHA-256 hashes + ed25519 signatures for manifests; chain-of-custody metadata attached to reports.

Key Management: integration points for KMS/HSM; local keystore for dev.

APIs: REST & gRPC for orchestration; webhooks for real-time forwarding.

Third-party adapters: EDR (CrowdStrike, SentinelOne), NAC (Cisco ISE, Aruba), Cloud APIs (AWS, Azure, GCP), SIEM (Elastic, Splunk), Ticketing (Jira, ServiceNow). (Adapters structured as pluggable modules.)

Configuration & CLI UX Standards

Use cobra + viper for CLI and config (env/file/flags).

Machine-readable output by default (JSON/NDJSON), human-friendly formatting optional.

--dry-run and --simulate for all destructive actions (sandboxed simulation mode).

Optional TUI: host groups, live metrics, progress bars.

Observability, Monitoring & Telemetry

Prometheus metrics exposed by each module: scan_count, active_workers, avg_host_latency, pcap_bytes, events_processed, playbook_runs, sandbox_active.

Tracing: distributed tracing for workflows (OpenTelemetry-ready).

Health & readiness probes for orchestration (HTTP /healthz, /readyz).

Alerting hooks: Prometheus + Alertmanager, plus webhook/Slack/email integrators.

Security, Integrity & Operational Hardening

Encrypted evidence: AES-256-GCM for pcaps and blob storage; metadata signed with ed25519.

Tamper-evidence: signed manifests and chain-of-custody for every incident and remediation.

RBAC: operator/manager/auditor roles for actions; signed action tokens stored in audit logs.

Code signing: binaries and playbooks signed for production allow-listing.

Secrets handling: runtime retrieval from KMS/HSM; no hard-coded secrets.

Safe defaults: conservative timeouts and low default concurrency (opt-in higher concurrency).

Playbook safety: rollbacks and dead-letter handling; sandbox-first verification.

Storage, Export Formats & Forensics

Output formats: JSON, NDJSON, CSV, SARIF, PDF, pcap.

PDF reports: forensic-grade universal template with signed footer and embedded verification steps.

PCAP handling: chunked, rotated, encrypted; path stored in signed manifest; truncated or filtered bodies by default for privacy.

Backups: encrypted backups for DB and evidence; retention policies configured.

Testing, CI/CD & Benchmarks

Unit tests for core modules; integration tests with containerized mock services.

Performance tests: synthetic lab with tcpreplay, containerized mock endpoints, and load scripts to validate 10k-host scanning behavior.

Nightly performance runs: memory leak checks, goroutine profiling, CPU profiles.

Fuzz & chaos tests: simulate noisy networks, dropped packets, and partial API failures.

Cross-compile CI matrix: linux/amd64, linux/arm64, windows/amd64; reproducible builds.

Dev & Ops Implementation Hints

Use gopacket for packet parsing and libpcap capture.

Use context.Context extensively for cancellation and graceful shutdown.

Use a hot-updateable, signed fingerprint DB for CVE & service signatures.

Make internal modules library-friendly (so UI or API servers can import scanner/fingerprint code).

Use gofpdf or commercial unidoc for PDF generation (unidoc recommended for production polish).

Use BadgerDB for high-performance local key/value storage; S3 for large encrypted blob storage.

Provide a simulate mode for playbooks to validate flows without touching infra.

Provide CLI subcommands for health checks and diagnostics (dump current config, list active workers, export metrics snapshot).
